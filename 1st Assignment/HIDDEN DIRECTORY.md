#REPORT ON DISCOVERING OF HIDDEN DIRECTORIES


##METHODOLOGY
To identify hidden or unlinked directories on the target website (http://testphp.vulnweb.com/), I used Gobuster, a directory and file brute-forcing tool. The enumeration was performed using a common wordlist (common.txt) provided by the SecLists project.
Command used:
gobuster dir -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 40 -o gobuster-results.txt
‚Ä¢	-u specifies the target URL.
‚Ä¢	-w points to the wordlist used for brute-forcing.
‚Ä¢	-t sets the number of concurrent threads.
‚Ä¢	-o specifies the output file for storing results.

This allowed me to discover directories and files by sending HTTP requests and analyzing status codes returned by the server



##FINDINGS
The scan revealed the following directories and files of interest:
Directory / File	                Status                                            Code	Description
/admin/	        :   301	Redirects to admin panel                        potentially sensitive
/cgi-bin/       :   403	Forbidden                                       commonly contains scripts; possible entry point
/CVS/	          :   200	Exposed version control system directory        misconfigured
/CVS/Entries	  :   200	VCS metadata                                    could reveal file structure
/CVS/Root       : 	200	CVS root config                                 may leak repository info
/images/	      :   200	Publicly accessible                             may host media or leak metadata
/pictures/	    :   301	Redirect                                        similar to /images/
/secured/	      :   301	Redirects to restricted resource                inspect for auth bypass
/vendor/	      :   301	May expose package manager files (e.g., PHP Composer)


##CONCLUSIONS
‚Ä¢	Sensitive and misconfigured directories like /admin, /secured, and /CVS were discovered, which could potentially be leveraged for further exploitation.
‚Ä¢	403 responses such as /cgi-bin/ suggest access control is in place, but these paths still exist and could be brute-forced or fuzzed further.
‚Ä¢	Exposure of CVS version control files is a misconfiguration and may leak source code or file structure of the application.
‚Ä¢	Crossdomain.xml should be examined to ensure it doesn‚Äôt allow excessive cross-origin access.
This enumeration step is crucial for identifying attack surfaces and misconfigurations during web application assessments.

Code / Script Used
Gobuster Command:
gobuster dir \
  -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/ \
  -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt \
  -t 40 \
  -o gobuster-results.txt
Optionally, the -x flag can be used to scan for specific file extensions (e.g., .php, .bak, .txt) if further enumeration is required.
